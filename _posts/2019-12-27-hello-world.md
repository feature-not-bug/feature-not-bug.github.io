First (and last) post of the year! I'm happy to finally create a space where I can share my thoughts and observations from both personal and work projects in tech. It's been a long time coming but the goal for this site is to capture and document work that either a) has little to no visibility from search engines or b) deliver higher quality content than what's readily available. It's completely possible that the direction of this site changes in the future and that is perfectly fine with me. That's about all for now. Happy holidays and see you in 2020!
