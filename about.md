I am currently a senior software engineer for a consulting firm based out of McLean, VA. Most of my professinal experience has been working as a full-stack developer using the Microsoft stack (.NET, C#, SQL) for web-based applications and leading small to medium-sized teams for high visibility IT programs in the cybersecurity space. Additionally, a lot of this experience was in [brownfield development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)) for fast-growing applications so I would *like* to think I have a decent grasp on a variety of topics such as refactoring, performance tuning, security, unit testing, integration testing, new feature development, data and tech migrations, devops and automation, version control, code reviews, and more.

My current interests and goals are to gain more exposure and hands-on development with cloud technologies, containers, and open-source. Thank you for taking the time to visit and feel free to contact me with any comments, questions, or feedback!
